# GUANXI
An online interface and medium of interchange between different people involved in an institution. In this case the institution 
is a college and the constituents are Students, Teachers and the Administration. This acts as a platform where Teachers can 
upload the marks, attendence, howework assignment, etc on a daily basis. Students can submit assignments online to their 
respective teachers via their accounts on this platform. This acts as a "virtual notice board" where the individual can 
get any notices, updates or news as soon as they log in. The Administration or college authorites can also update notices 
about events going on in the college solving the issue of spreading information to everyone without the need of posters 
and pamphlets. One of the main features is a Forum where a student/group can chat with Teachers and discuss problems, 
doubts, etc.
